## Description
This is the Machine Learning task for the emotion recognition made using Resnet. There are 7 classes of emotions that are trained and tested:
*0: 'Angry', 1: 'Disgust', 2: 'Fear', 3: 'Happy', 4: 'Sad', 5: 'Surprise', 6: 'Neutral'*

Using OpenCV, it was possible to demonstrate the position of the face with accuracy of its emotion.
